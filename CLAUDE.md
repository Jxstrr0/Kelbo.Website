# Notes for Claude

Kelbo's personal site, hosted on GitHub Pages from the `main` branch root.
Live at https://jxstrr0.github.io/Kelbo.Website/

## Working on this repo

- **Auto-merge is allowed.** Once a change is pushed, the PR is open, and
  nothing is failing, merge it yourself without asking first.
- **Every change must end up on `main`**, because that's what goes live.
  Work on a branch, open a PR, merge it into `main`, then check the live
  site updated.
- Kelbo is a beginner+ coder and mostly on his phone. Explain changes in
  plain language and keep code readable, with comments on anything
  non-obvious. He may edit files in the GitHub web or mobile editor.
- Only publish personal details Kelbo has approved. The site is public.
- **The site uses the name Kelbo only.** Never put his real first or last
  name (or his initials) anywhere on the site, in page text, titles, `og:`
  tags, alt text, comments, or the link preview image.

## Hard rules

- **Static only:** plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. No frameworks, npm,
  bundlers, or build step.
- **No secrets.** The repo is public. Never commit API keys, tokens, or
  passwords. If a tool needs a key, talk through options with Kelbo first.
- Mobile first (works down to 360px wide), light and dark mode via
  `prefers-color-scheme` with every colour in CSS variables, accessible
  (semantic HTML, visible focus, good contrast, alt text,
  `prefers-reduced-motion`).
- Use relative links only, because the site lives under `/Kelbo.Website/`
  and may move to a custom domain later. The one exception is the `og:`
  link-preview tags in each page's `<head>`, which must be absolute; update
  them if the domain changes. `404.html` is the other exception: GitHub
  serves it at any missing address, however deep, so a small script in its
  `<head>` adds a `<base>` pointing at the site's top folder before any
  links load. Keep that script first in the `<head>`.
- The link preview image is `assets/social-preview.jpg` (1200×630, the neon
  look plus the four game covers). Regenerate it if the covers change a lot.

## Where things live

- `projects.json` is the single source of truth for projects. `main.js`
  renders it. Adding a project should never need an HTML edit.
- The status labels and progress-bar fill amounts are in `STATUSES` at the
  top of `main.js`.
- The look is "neon arcade" (dark synthwave hero, pink/cyan glow, project
  cards with cover images). Fonts: Space Grotesk + Press Start 2P (pixel
  accents only, always uppercase). Game covers live in `assets/covers/`
  (640×480 JPG, captured from each live game).
- Motion lives at the bottom of `style.css`, all inside
  `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`; `main.js` handles scroll reveal
  and smooth filtering (FLIP) and skips both when reduce motion is on. Content must never depend on JS or
  motion to become visible.
- Tools live in `tools/<name>/` with their own `index.html`, CSS, and JS,
  reusing `../../style.css`. They run in the browser only (localStorage,
  no server), so their data stays on the visitor's device.
- Sections: `games.html`, `trading.html`, and `ai.html` each list the
  projects whose `category` matches the list's `data-category` (Game,
  Trading, AI). The home page tiles link to them and show counts.
- Games each live in their own repo with their own GitHub Pages site
  (GarageToGlory, RedSkies, BaccaratTable, 350Chev). This site only links to
  them via `link` (the pink Play it button) and `code` (the repo). The home
  page "Pick a game" cards are the `featured` projects (max 4).
- The nav (Games, Trading, AI, Projects; the KELBO wordmark is home) is copied
  in every page and only just fits at 360px. Test before adding to it.
- The AI Trading Journal is `journal.html` + `journal.js` + `journal.css`,
  with entries in `journal.json` (a list, newest first by `date`). The
  record is calculated from each call's `grade` (hit/partial/miss, null =
  not graded) and each trade's `result` (percent; missing = open). The
  field list is at the top of `journal.js`. Entries can be long forecasts
  (calls, scenarios, levels, sectors, schedule, plan); copy their content
  faithfully and only fill in grades and the recap when Kelbo reports them.
  Kelbo updates it periodically; when he sends views or trades, write the
  entry and an honest "ai" coach note. Never invent trades or results, and
  prefer percentages over dollar amounts. `journal.js` borrows `el()` and
  `reveal()` from `main.js`, so load `main.js` first.
- Write every "ai" coach note in a general voice, not to Kelbo: judge the
  trade or idea ("winners averaged +21.5%", "holding overnight without a
  planned exit was the mistake"), never "you" or "your". Same honesty, same
  specifics.
- Options trades live in `options.json` (fields at the top of `journal.js`),
  copied from Kelbo's own options ledger. The page works out each return
  from `paid`/`sold` premiums and feeds the record's options group. Leave
  out contract counts and dollar P&L. When he sends new trades, add them
  oldest first, bump `updated`, and refresh the `ai` coach note honestly.
- The Prediction Tracker in `tools/prediction-tracker/` is parked: still in
  the repo but removed from `projects.json` (README has the block to
  restore it).
- The home page contact form posts to Web3Forms, which emails Kelbo. Its
  `access_key` in `index.html` is public by design (it can only send him a
  message); never put his email address in the site. Web3Forms rejects
  server-side posts, so test it from a real browser on the live site.
- `README.md` is Kelbo's plain-English editing guide. Keep it up to date
  when how things work changes.
